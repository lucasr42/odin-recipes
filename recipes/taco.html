    <blockquote>
        Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 
        3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, 
        mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. 
        This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Dried chile peppers: </strong>The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, 
            chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Beef:</strong> Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. 
            When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings:</strong> You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, 
            cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Olive oil:</strong> Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vinegar: </strong>Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tortillas:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Onion and cilantro:</strong> Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers 
            soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook 
            until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.
        </li>
        <li>
            Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.
        </li>
    </ol>
